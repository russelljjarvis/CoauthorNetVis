This is like [etudier](https://github.com/edsu/etudier) except that network graphs are interactive and Google scholar scraping is completely bypassed in favor of the dissemin API.

This is like [GeoSocialVis](https://github.com/dsaffo/GeoSocialVis) except that it is written in python not java script, and so far this application fails to include geographic information. Geographic networks are in development.
