Building an author network visualization? Why not avoid Google Scholar scraping entirely?

This app is similar to [etudier](https://github.com/edsu/etudier) except that network graphs are interactive and Google scholar scraping is completely bypassed in favor of the dissemin API. This app is also like [GeoSocialVis](https://github.com/dsaffo/GeoSocialVis) except that it is written in python not java script and so far this application fails to include geographic information. [Geographic networks](https://share.streamlit.io/russelljjarvis/sirg_geo_net/main/app3.py) are also possible using this application.
